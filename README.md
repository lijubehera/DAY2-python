👨‍💻 Day 2 of My Python Learning Journey — Variables, Data Types & More! 🐍

 Today was all about understanding how Python stores, identifies, and works with data — and it's getting more interesting every minute! 🔥

📘 What I covered today:

🔸 Variables – Containers that hold data like numbers, text, etc.

 🔸 Data Types – Python auto-detects types like int, float, str, bool, and None.

 🔸 Operators – Learnt the basic arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.

 🔸 Typecasting & type() – Converting one data type to another (like int("32")) and checking types.

 🔸 input() Function – Used to take input from the user, always returns data as a string.

✍️ Fun fact: Even if a user enters 34, it's treated as "34" — a string! You need to convert it using int() if you want to perform calculations. 💡

 These little daily wins are building a solid foundation! 💪

📍 Key Takeaway: Python is super smart when it comes to identifying data types, but we should still understand how it works behind the scenes.

👣 Step by step, I’m moving closer to becoming a confident Python developer.
